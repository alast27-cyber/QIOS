*(Note: I have removed the Gemini AI dependency for now to guarantee stability. We can add it back later.)*

#### **Step 2: Update Your Render Build Command**

This is the most critical step. We will tell Render to run a special version of `npm install` that *only* installs the packages listed under `"dependencies"`.

1.  Go to your Render dashboard for the `qios-2` service.
2.  Go to the **"Settings"** tab.
3.  Scroll down to the **"Build & Deploy"** section.
4.  Find the **"Build Command"** box. It currently says `npm install`.
5.  **Change it to:**
    ```
    npm install --production
    ```
6.  Click **"Save Changes"**.

#### **Step 3: Trigger a Clean Redeploy**

1.  At the top right of your Render dashboard, click the **"Manual Deploy"** button.
2.  Select **"Clear build cache & deploy"**.

### What Happens Now

1.  Render will pull your updated `package.json`.
2.  It will run the new build command: `npm install --production`.
3.  This command will **completely ignore** the heavy `electron` and `electron-packager` packages. It will only install `express` and `socket.io`.
4.  The build will be much faster and use far less memory.
5.  The server will start with a lean, stable set of dependencies and will **not crash**.

After the deployment is finished and says "Your service is live," **close your stuck `QIOS-Browser.exe` and run it again.**

This time, when it connects to the URL, the server will be running and stable. The "Application loading..." screen will disappear after a few seconds, and you will see the Quantum Competitive Snake game, ready to play.

This is the standard way to optimize a Node.js application for production. After this fix, your server will be leaner, start faster, and the Electron app will load correctly.
